This is a simple way to play Tic-Tac-Toe
with two players on the command line. 

Each game is an instance of the class
'Board', which the user can import from the 
module without any nonstandard dependencies. 
Gameplay progresses as expected after calling
either main() from the module or Board.command_loop()
from an instance of class Board.
